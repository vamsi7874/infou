# 🧠 InfoU

> **InfoU** is a data-sharing and ETL automation platform designed to integrate information from multiple utility sources — keeping your business connected with daily insights and updates.

---

## 🌍 Vision

The vision of **InfoU** is to seamlessly **collect, transform, and deliver** useful data to multiple client applications and APIs — removing data hurdles and ensuring consistency across systems.

InfoU acts as a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline:

### 🔍 Extract

We gather real-time data from multiple APIs — including **weather**, **agriculture**, and **news** — so your applications can rely on consistent and diversified information sources.

### 🔧 Transform

Different APIs often return data in inconsistent formats. InfoU automatically **cleans, restructures, and standardizes** this data into a uniform format ready for your business needs.

### 💾 Load

We use **MongoDB** as our storage engine — a fast, flexible, and schema-less NoSQL database perfect for handling structured and unstructured data efficiently.

## 🤖 AI Integration

AI is revolutionizing the way we interact with data — and **InfoU** embraces it fully.  
We’ve integrated **LangChain** with **Gemini** and **ChatGPT** models to bring **AI-driven insights and conversations** directly into the platform.

🗨️ Our AI-powered **Chat Section** allows intelligent question-answering and data exploration, helping users get the right information faster and in a more natural way.

## 🛠️ Planned Improvements

We’re committed to evolving **InfoU** for better scalability, performance, and user experience.  
Here are some upcoming enhancements:

- ⚡ **Performance Optimization:** Add skeleton loaders and caching for smoother experiences.
- 🧩 **Frontend Enhancements:** Optimize Angular UI components for faster rendering and responsiveness.
- 🧠 **Smarter AI Responses:** Refine LangChain prompts for more accurate and human-like replies.
- 🚀 **API Optimization:** Improve API response times and reliability across all modules.
